Config files

## Structure
This repo replicates the structure of `~/`.

Each file in `~/` is meant to be symlinked to a config here.

## Dependencies
- bash
- URxvt
- i3
- capitaine-cursors
- VS Code

## Initilizing
A new system can be initialized to use these config files by running the `link` script.

The script will create links from the repo files to the corresponding locations in `~/`.

**Users will be prompted before overwites, backups are reccomended**
